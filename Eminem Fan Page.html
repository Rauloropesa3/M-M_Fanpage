        <br><strong><u>Bio</u></strong>
        <p> Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in 1972 in
             Missouri, Eminem had a turbulent childhood.
              He dropped out of school in the ninth grade
               and worked odd jobs until finally making it
                as a rapper upon the release of The Slim
                 Shady LP in early 1999.
                 </p><p>Its been a while since Eminem hit the scene, 
                     but he still seems to suprise the industry with 
                     his wordplay and unmatched lyrics. You might not 
                     like his style,or his music, but when it comes to 
                     Rap you have to respect him. Many have tried to go
                      against him and have failed, proving why he is the 
                      best MC of our time. </p> <strong><u>Top 5 songs:</u></strong>
